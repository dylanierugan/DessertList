This project is structured using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern.

Project Structure
Model: Contains the data models, including Dessert and DessertDetail.

ViewModel: Houses the DessertViewModel, which manages the app's data logic and business rules. This layer serves as the bridge between the models and views, preparing data for display and handling user input.

View: Comprises the UI components, specifically DessertView and DessertDetailView. These views present the data to the user and reflect any updates made by the ViewModel.

Utilities: Includes the networking class and Enum file.
